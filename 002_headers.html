		<h1> My First Day At School </h1>
		<p> I still remember the excitement as I walked into the gates with my books . The science labouratory stool tall and intimidiating, but something about it felt like home . I was ready to become a science student . </p>
		
		<h2> My First Labouratory Coat </h2>
		<p> The first time I wore a lab coat ,I feltnlike a scientist already . We were asked to perform a simple titration experiment . I did not know how to hold a pipette properly, but i pretended like i did . That day marked the beginning of my love for chemistry . </p>

		<h3> The Physics Surprise </h3>
		<p> Physics was tough at first. The equations , the calculations and the laws, they made my spin. But one day , I solved a complicated circuit problem on the board and even my teacher was surprised. That day, I knew I could handle anything if i did not give up. </p>
 
		<h4> The Biology Sketchbook </h4>
		<p> Biology was not just about reading for me. I had a sketchbook filled with diagram; the heart, the digestive system. </p>

		<h5> Group Project and Lab Accidents </h5>
