Plans:

I am committed to mastering frontend development as a key step in becoming a fullstack software engineer. My learning plan involves a hands-on approach, combining short, engaging videos, reading resources, and consistent coding practice. I aim to build a solid foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, followed by frameworks like React. I plan to learn through real-world projects and gradually integrate modern tools and libraries to enhance my skills.

Goals:

Gain proficiency in core frontend technologies: HTML, CSS, JavaScript.

Master a popular framework like React.

Build and deploy responsive, interactive web applications.

Understand UX/UI principles and implement them effectively.

Create a portfolio of projects to demonstrate my frontend skills.

Eventually integrate my frontend knowledge with backend skills to become a fullstack developer.

Motivation: I am driven by the desire to build beautiful, functional web applications that people love to use. The creative and visual aspect of frontend development excites me—it’s where code meets design. I want to empower myself with the skills to bring ideas to life and see immediate results on the screen, which keeps me motivated to learn and grow every day.
